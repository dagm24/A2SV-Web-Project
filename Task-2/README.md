# 📝 Todo List App (TypeScript)

A **Todo List Web Application** built with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. This app allows users to:

- Add tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Requirements
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- [Optional] A local server like **Live Server** for a smoother experience

## 📦 Run Locally

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dagm24/A2SV-Web-Project.git
cd A2SV-Web-Project/Task-2
```

Then open `public/ToDo.html` directly in your browser, **or** use a local server like **Live Server (VS Code extension)** for the best experience.
